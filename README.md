# 🚀 Bouncy Numbers

## 📖 Introduction

Numbers can exhibit fascinating patterns:  

- **Increasing Numbers**: A number where no digit is exceeded by the digit to its left.  
  - Example: `134468`  

- **Decreasing Numbers**: A number where no digit is exceeded by the digit to its right.  
  - Example: `66420`  

- **Bouncy Numbers**: A number that is neither increasing nor decreasing.  
  - Example: `155349`  

## 📊 Observations

- There are no bouncy numbers below `100`.  
- Over **half** the numbers below `1000` are bouncy (`525`).  
- The smallest number where **50%** of the numbers are bouncy is `538`.  
- By the time we reach `21780`, **90%** of the numbers are bouncy.  

## ❓ The Challenge

Find the **smallest number** where the proportion of bouncy numbers reaches **exactly 99%**.
